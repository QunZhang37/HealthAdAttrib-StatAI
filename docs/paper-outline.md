- Research questions: Which channels drive incremental conversions? How stable is attribution across models?

## 2. Methods
- Synthetic cohort design; Markov-chain removal, logistic/Bayesian logit, Shapley; deep LSTM
- Evaluation: AUC/Brier, attribution stability, counterfactual path tests, ROI framing

## 3. Results
- Comparative attribution shares; calibration & discrimination; sensitivity analyses

## 4. Discussion
- Practical implications for budget allocation; limitations and ethics
